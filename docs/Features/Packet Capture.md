2. Click on ‘Start Capture’. Press start capture.

5. When the file name prompt appears, you can check the file name and captured data statistics here.
6. Once the file is saved, it will be uploaded to the server. You can download it form anywhere via the history menu. 

### Using IR Pannel while Packet Capturing:

4. Press Command among the command list.
