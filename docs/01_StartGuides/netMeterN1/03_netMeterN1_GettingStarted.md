# Getting Started

### Connecting device to WAN

![neMeterN1 Connecting WAN](./img/netMeterN1_WANConnection.png)

netMeter operates through a cloud-based web UI. To control netMeter via the web UI, 
netMeter must be able to obtain an IP address to connect to the internet.

Please correctly plug in an internet-connectable LAN cable into the WAN port (RJ-45) of netMeter. 
It is located on the back right side of the device.

### Powering ON

If you press and hold the 'Power Button' for more than 1 second, the device's power will turn on.
When the device is powered on, the 'Power' LED on the status indicator will illuminate in red.

While the device is booting up, the 'Ready' LED on the status indicator will flash every 2 seconds.

If the device doesn't boot up normally within 1 minute after powering on, it will flash the 'Power' LED 
for 2 seconds and then automatically shut down. If this happens, please contact our customer service department 
as there may be an issue with the device.

Once the boot process is complete and the device is ready and online, the 'Ready' LED will remain illuminated.

If the device fails to obtain an IP address to connect to the internet, the 'Ready' LED will blink twice every 2 seconds.

netMeter. You can also visit via [Link](https://app.netmeter.io/)
