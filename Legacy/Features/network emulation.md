# Network Emulation
## How can I conduct Network Emulation?

Network emulation simulates physical bandwidth limits, loss, and delays for LAN ports. All traffic can be manually controlled for both inbound and outbound directions. 

You can filter outbound packets by destination IP, or filter inbound packets by source IP using filter rules. IP and ports are optional. If only the protocol has been set, all packets will be filtered accordingly.

*If you intend to filter multicast packets, you should add IP addresses to the outbound filter rules.

Toggling each fuction will take effect immediately.
