## What is a Good Ping test?
A good Ping Test measures how quickly data travels between computers. Lower ping indicates faster communication, crucial for real-time activities like gaming or video calls. 


Here's what different ping ranges mean:
    * Under 20 ms: Excellent for gaming, ensuring minimal delays.
    * 20-50 ms: Good for most online activities, providing smooth performance.
    * 50-100 ms: Average, suitable for casual gaming but may cause delays in competitive play.
    * 100-150 ms: Noticeable lag in gaming, but still usable for video calls and streaming.
    * Over 150 ms: Leads to significant lag, impacting gaming and real-time applications.
